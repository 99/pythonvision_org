Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

More than a HOWTO, this document is a HOW-DO-I use Python to do my image processing tasks. Image processing means many things to many people, so I will use a couple of examples from my research to illustrate.

Basic Software
---------------

I am going to assuyme that you have installed the following:
    - Python 2.5, 2.6, or 2.7 (avoid 3.0 or 3.1---too new)
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
    - ipython

Under Linux, you can just install your distribution's packages (install at least python-numpy, python-scipy, python-numpy-dev, python-matplotlib, ipython). Under Windows or Mac OS, this is more complicated. Fortunately, some people have done the work for us and built packages that have this. Install either Python xy or the Enthought Python Distribution (actually this works on Linux too, if you prefer this method).

Other Software
--------------

You will need one of the following packages:
    - Python Image Library
    - readmagick
