# How to Contribute

Pythonvision wants your help! Write tutorials, introduce your software,
write about your experience using Python. We have a page for
[ideas](/contribute/ideas), but we welcome your own.

Step by step with github
========================

1.  Get a [github](http://www.github.com) account (theyâ€™re free).
2.  Fork the
    [pythonvision\_org](http://www.github.com/luispedro/pythonvision_org)
    project.
3.  Edit it. This can even be done directly as a text box on the github
    project page. Just like a wiki.
4.  Send me a pull request or an [email](mailto:lpc@cmu.edu).

Of course, you can just use a local fork with git and email me.

This is a [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) website, using
[jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
