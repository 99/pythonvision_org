I am pleased to announce a new version of mahotas, my computer vision package 
for mahotas.

What's New
-----------

Many small improvements:

- Greyscale erosion & dilation
- Use imread module (if available)
- Add output argument to erode() & dilate()
- Add 14th Haralick feature (patch by MattyG) --- currently off by default
- Improved zernike interface (zernike_moments)
- Add remove_bordering to labeled
- Faster implementation of ``bwperim``
- Add ``roundness`` shape feature

And a bugfix:

- Fix installation of test data


About Mahotas
-------------

Mahotas is a computer vision library. Algorithms operate on numpy arrays, but 
are implemented in C++ for speed (efficiency is a major concern of mahotas).

It includes algorithms such as watershed, basic morphological operations, 
feature computation, and other tidbits.
