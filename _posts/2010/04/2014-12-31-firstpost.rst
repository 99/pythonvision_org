Python vision has been progressing nicely over the past few days as I have used
it for my structured procrastination.

I am still wondering whether people will react positively to this new concept
of a website, which is *almost a wiki*, but not really. Most wikis suffer from
a lack of inputs and too much spam. This will have no spam.

I also hope that getting some people on the mailing list will help create a
community with the website serving as support. Remains to be seen.
