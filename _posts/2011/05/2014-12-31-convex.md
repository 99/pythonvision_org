title: Computing the convex hull area of a 2D binary particle

A particle class is needed to handle the chromosomes extracted from a
metaphase image.

For this very beginning, the class only handles the counterstain image
(DAPI), it is possible to :

1.  display a particle vertically,
2.  compute the ratio between the particle area and the convex hull
    area, in order to distinguish between single chromosomes and
    overlapping chromosomes. The convex hull area is computed with a
    [funny
    formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon_area#Properties).

With two features as the particle area and the ratio between the
particle area and the convex hull area, it should be possible to start
to classify the particles into four categories:

\# non overlapping chromosomes, \# overlapping chromosomes, \# nuclei,
\# remaining small stuffs .

[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.sourceforge.net/) may be considered.

[The script written to test the
class](https://docs.google.com/uc?id=0B4TdqXWu2MOWMGU0YzAxNTgtNDJmYi00YjQ2LWFjN2MtYjFjY2YzNmRjYzg1&export=download&hl=en),
instanciates two particle objects, rotates them and calculates the
“convexity” ratio. To use it with your images, modify the path to the
image, numpy, scipy, pylab, pymorph, mahotas must be installed.
