I’m happy to announce a new version of mahotas, version 0.7!

WHAT’S NEW
==========

New features
------------

The major feature is that scipy is no longer used! The story is that I
was without a hard drive for two weeks and didn’t have scipy, so I wrote
mahotas to work without it.

The necessary interpolation functions from ndimage have been ported over
to mahotas.

Bugfixes
--------

-   Local binary patterns were wrongly computed. Fixed
-   GIL handling on error is now correct (reported by Gareth McCaughan)
-   2D TAS features are now correct (reported by Jenn Bakal)
-   FreeImage is now fixed on 64 bit machines

Minor
-----

Zernike moment computation allows the specification of the centre of
mass. Support loading 1-bit images with freeimage

Get it from [PyPI](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mahotas/0.7).
