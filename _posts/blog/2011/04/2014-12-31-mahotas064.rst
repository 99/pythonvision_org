I'm happy to announce a new version of mahotas, version 0.6.4.

WHAT'S NEW
----------

Major change is that Mac OS compilation now works! Thanks to K-Michael
Aye for the patch that saved the day.

Minor changes include fixes to ``cwatershed`` and adding the tests to
the source distribution (use `python setup.py test` to run them).

Get it from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mahotas/0.6.4>`__.
