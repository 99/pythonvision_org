Ideas
=====

Here are some ideas for contribution:

1. More tutorials are always good.
2. Implement RSS feeds for the `blog </blog>`_. This is a `gitcms
   <http://luispedro.org/software/git-cms>`_ project.
3. Organise the software pages.
4. Do a screencast of using python for computer vision.
5. Logo and artwork for pythonvision.org. You might even redesign the whole
   website look.

These are just ideas. Any contribution is welcome.
