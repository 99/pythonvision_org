Here are some ideas for contribution:

1. More tutorials are always good.
2. Organise the software pages.
3. Add examples of anythin you have done
4. Do a screencast of using python for computer vision.
5. Logo and artwork for pythonvision.org. You might even redesign the whole
   website look.

These are just ideas. Any contribution is welcome.
