About Pythonvision.org
======================

`Pythonvision.org <http://pythonvision.org>`_ started out as a `tutorial
</tutorial>`_, then it grew as I realised that there were several researchers
using Python for computer vision, but the efforts were scattered across
projects, forums, mailing-lists.

Pythonvision.org tries to aggregate all of these efforts into a single website
and mailing-list.
