# About Pythonvision.org

[Pythonvision.org](http://pythonvision.org) started out as a
[tutorial](basic-tutorial), then it grew as I realised that there were several
researchers using Python for computer vision, but the efforts were scattered
across projects, forums, mailing-lists.

Pythonvision.org tries to aggregate all of these efforts into a single website
and mailing-list.
